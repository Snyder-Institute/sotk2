Description: sotk2 is an R package for integrating omics datasets using modules derived from
    non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) or consensus NMF (cNMF). The workflow
    concatenates basis (W) matrices across ranks and datasets, computes metagene–metagene
    correlations, constructs a correlation network, and applies community detection to
    identify integrative biological modules. sotk2 also supports rank inspection through
    community coverage plots and provides utilities for gene-level interpretation via
    metagene-associated genes (MAGs) and contributing community genes.
