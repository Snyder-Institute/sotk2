\title{Select contributing community genes from MAGs}
\usage{
contributingCommunityGenes(object, magL, proportion = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{SOSet} object}

\item{magL}{Nested list of MAGs returned by \code{getMAGs()}.}

\item{proportion}{Numeric. Threshold between 0 and 1 (inclusive). A gene must appear in
more than this fraction of metagenes within a community to be retained. Default is 0.5.}
}
\value{
Named list where each element corresponds to a community (e.g., \code{"Community_1"}).
Each community element is a named list keyed by dataset name (e.g., \code{dataName}) and
contains a character vector of contributing genes.
}
\description{
Aggregates metagene-associated genes (MAGs) at the community level and selects genes that
repeatedly appear across metagenes in the same community.
}
\details{
A gene is selected as a contributing community gene if it appears as a MAG in more than
\code{proportion} of metagenes within that community.
}
\examples{
mags <- getMAGs(soObj, list(GLASS = expr))
commGenes <- contributingCommunityGenes(soObj, mags)
